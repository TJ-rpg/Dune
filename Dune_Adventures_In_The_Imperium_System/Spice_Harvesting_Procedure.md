Spice harvesting is a dangerous and often random business seeking out ‘spice blows’ where raw spice explodes from under the desert and collects on the surface. Spice blows produce the largest quantities of melange and occur when gases produced in
what is called the ‘pre-spice mass’ build up to critical
pressure and throw the mass up to the surface of the
desert, sucking whatever was on the surface down,
deep below the sand. A brief exposure to sun and air
transforms this mass into melange. Being in the same
place as a spice blow is usually fatal. Houses licensed
to harvest spice uses spotters, flying at a safe height
above the desert to watch for signs of a spice blow.
Once detected, the spotter pilot communicates the co-
ordinates back to base and, ideally, a carryall arrives with
one or more harvesting teams on board at the exact
point the melange is ready to harvest. Even if they miss
the blow itself the spice may remain on the surface for
some time where it can be harvested. But such fields are
not as rich as a recent blow.  

It then becomes a race against time. Harvesting teams
must gather as much melange as they can before their
activities are cut short by the arrival of a sandworm, a
hostile harvesting team, or a sandstorm which will bury
or blow away the spice. While they are working, the
harvesting team may be watched over by further spotters, ready to warn of wormsign, storm, or hostile action.
Some Houses like to economise on these essential
safety measures, and those Houses lose melange and
harvesters when sandworms consume their harvesting
teams or when a violent storm destroys the harvester.
Even with an effective and conscientious spotter team,
sandworms and storms can move so fast it proves
impossible to get the harvesters to safety before they
strike.  

Spice lost in this way is rarely recovered by the licensed
Houses. More often it is taken by informal teams of
smugglers or Fremen harvesters who understand more
about how to operate on the sand without attracting
unwanted attention. Though not even they can always
find shelter from a fast-approaching storm.  

Spotter pilots are adept at finding spice blows. Some
claim to have what amounts to an ‘instinct’ for it, while
others rely on a combination of system and luck. It is
important to fly low enough to be able to detect small
changes on the ground while remaining high enough to
get out of the way should a blow occur close by. There’s
not a spotter pilot on Arrakis who hasn’t a tale to tell of
the time they narrowly escaped death when they got
too close to a blow. Some, of course, do not live to tell
their stories. Pilots who report false positives—causing
their bosses to waste resources sending a carryall to
somewhere there is little or no spice to be harvested—
don’t keep their jobs very long.  

Once the position and size of the spice blow is established, an operator sends out a carryall, complete with
the required complement of harvesters and workers.
The carryall drops the harvesters off close to the spice
blow then retreats to a safe position; far enough not
to be conspicuous or interfere with the harvesting
operation but close enough to come in and pick up
the harvesters should a rival operation, worm, or storm
threaten the valuable spice.  

Carryalls are mobile factories where the first stages of spice processing take place, where the spice is cleaned of gross
pollutants, compacted, and vacuum-packed, ready for
further processing in Carthag or Arrakeen. 
As the carryalls are often many
weeks away from the cities, they may carry domestic
staff—cooks and cleaners—to maintain the crew and
keep the workspaces up to standards. Harvester crews
are also on board the carryall when they are not working
on the sand and, at such times, they are expected to
lend a hand with day-to-day operations. At times, an
Imperial inspector may be on board, to ensure that the
Emperor is not being shorted a single solari worth of
spice he is owed.
