**Notes:**  
A Great House, Ecaz mass produces unique substances and narcotics, including Sapho juice, elacca, semuta, and verite. Ruled by Archduke Armand Ecaz, the Ecaz won their War of Assassins against House Moritani 5 years ago. But Ecaz hasn’t recovered economically from the conflict, and the aging Archduke is without an heir. They are no friend to the Harkonnens, but neither are they steadfast allies of the Emperor.  

House Ecaz is currently in decline from once being a major force in the Landsraad. With the Archduke Armand in retirement and all his heirs having been killed in the war with House Moritani, it falls on the lesser nobles to rebuild what remains of the House and regain their former glory. Lady Caranda Ecaz, a distant niece of Archduke Armand, is the current head of the House’s presence on Kaitain and within the Landsraad. The House is currently in good standing with the other Great and Minor Houses of the Landsraad, other than Houses Moritani and Harkonnen, and has no active wars or feuds.  

Lady Caranda Ecaz has risen through sheer will and determination up the ranks to become head of the Ecaz household. She is determined to get revenge on the Harkonnens for their role in the death of her noble cousins and the harm done to her House. House Ecaz is not as powerful as it was in Archduke Armand’s prime, but now actively seeks alliances and opportunities to strengthen their hand in openly declaring kanly against the Harkonnens.
