**Notes:**  
House Varmoth hails from the formidable planet Thundäruk, a world where nature and ingenuity intertwine in spectacular fashion. On this rugged planet, its inhabitants have cultivated enormous moth chrysalises crafted from a mysterious, energy-charged material. These chrysalises capture the fierce power of lightning and the relentless fury of storms, transforming into colossal bio-domes known as Chrysalis Bastials. These living fortresses can be grown so vast that they shelter entire cities beneath their luminous, organic arches. From these very chrysalises emerge giant moths—majestic, awe-inspiring creatures large enough to be ridden, symbolising both freedom and the raw might of nature.  

Thundäruk itself is a land of extremes. It is a dark, forbidding sphere defined by rugged, mountainous terrain and ceaseless lightning storms that scorch the skies. The planet is warmed only by the gentle, distant glow of a red dwarf star, whose scant light is deftly concentrated by the Chrysalis Bastials to illuminate the walled cities below. Here, the majority of inhabitants find refuge within these engineered sanctuaries, living under the constant threat of exile into a merciless, survival-driven wilderness. This threat is exacerbated by a pervasive, ritualistic devotion to the Storm Gods—a practice that, while ostensibly spiritual, now serves as a superficial tool of control wielded by the noble House. Even as Thundäruk silently absorbs clandestine and compromising intelligence within its secretive confines, little of its guarded knowledge ever escapes into the wider realm.  

Within this austere and enigmatic society, the noble classes set themselves apart through their flamboyant style. They adorn themselves in opulent garments fashioned from silky moth threads—a fabric that glimmers with a subtle iridescence. Their appearance is further marked by long, flowing beards and a cascade of curly hair, hallmarks of their storied heritage and a visible claim to their elevated status.
