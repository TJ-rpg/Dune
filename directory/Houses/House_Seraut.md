**Notes:**  
House Seraut is a clothier focusing on stylish water reclamation, having earned their riches from breakthroughs in stillsuit technology. They specialize in textile construction for home treatments and garments offering protection from the heat and sunlight while also helping capture and reclaim condensation. Not only are they tastemakers for Arrakis, some suspect their army of stylists may also be spies who gather information on the nobles they dress. While House Seraut is not known for violence, they wield gossip like knives, socially savaging anyone who insults them.  

They also administer Arrakeen on behalf of the Harkonnens (who do not bother themselves with such menial and insignificant tasks).

Lady Behati, Viscountess of House Seraut is a woman of excess. Bold and colorful, she is unapologetic about her water wealth.
