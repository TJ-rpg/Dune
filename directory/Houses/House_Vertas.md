**Notes:**  
House Vertas rules over Nexis, a world defined by its luminous, engineered landscapes. Nexis is a planet of towering crystalline factories, vast fields of bioluminescent flora, and sprawling energy-harvesting complexes. Here, nature and machine are seamlessly intertwined, symbolising the House’s innovative synthesis of environmental stewardship and industrial might.  

House Vertas is renowned for developing innovative and novel spice mining technology.  

At the helm of House Vertas is Duke Damar Vertas, a visionary leader whose strategic genius is rivaled only by his unwavering commitment to progress. His consort, Lady Zevara Vertas, is celebrated for her political acumen and grace at court. Together, they are raising Rovan Vertas and Kaiya Vertas, who are already making their mark in both technological innovation and statecraft. The family’s intricate web of alliances and rivalries—cemented through carefully arranged marriages and political negotiations—forms the backbone of their enduring influence.  

House Vertas’s ascent was hard-fought. Early in its history, the House was locked in a bitter trade war with House Tharix, a rival faction committed to traditional manufacturing practices. Through a combination of innovative breakthroughs and shrewd economic strategies, House Vertas not only secured exclusive contracts with key Houses but also engineered covert solutions to navigate the occasional wrath of the Padishah Emperor. Their ability to adapt and thrive in a volatile political landscape has cemented their reputation as both formidable competitors and indispensable allies.  
 
House Vertas hold a spice mining contract on Arrakis for around 5% of total production, located in an area called the Hagga Basin (due to its southerly location, the area does not produce as much spice as the deep desert but also has less sandworm presence).
