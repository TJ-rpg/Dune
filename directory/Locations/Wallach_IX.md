### OVERVIEW
Also called the Chapterhouse, Wallach IX is home to the
Bene Gesserit and serves as their greatest training facility.  

### HISTORY
The history of Wallach IX is tied to a hatred of humanity.
Millennia ago, Yorek Thurr ruled the planet in service
to Omnius. Thurr, even ascending as a ruler, worked as
a traitor inside the League of Nobles for the thinking
machines in hopes of gaining more power and position.  

He left human space to rule Wallach IX and undergo
the life-extending procedure. Upon gaining dominance
of the planet, Thurr focused on the eradication of all
human life. One of the many diabolic atrocities Thurr
masterminded was the Omnius Scourge, a deadly
airborne virus. Thurr escaped Wallach IX before the
League of Nobles initiated the Great Purge on the
planet. The devastated planet was taken over by the
cymeks, who ruled it until their destruction.  

Wallach IX became the homeworld centuries ago to
its current rulers, the Bene Gesserit. The Sisterhood
is critical to the continued existence of Wallach IX, as
the planet would collapse economically without them.
The few exports are tied to their training and schools,
reinforcing their importance, and increasing their numbers with each passing day. Every Sister has stepped
on Wallach IX at least once, always for training on the
Chapterhouse, and later potentially for a meeting with
the Mother Superior or to receive special assignments.  

The importance of Wallach IX cannot be understated,
and no vessel is allowed entry onto the planet or to
reside in space around it without prior approval.  

### CULTURE
Wallach IXâ€™s culture is one of obedience and community.
The Chapterhouse is ruled by the Mother Superior who
reinforces the Bene Gesserit beliefs and the mission of the
creation of the Kwisatz Haderach. Over 90% of the population are Bene Gesserit either in training or graduated.
Anyone else is either a worker, a guest, or a prisoner.  

### ENVIRONMENT
Wallach IX is a forest ecosystem with cities carved out
over the planet. Each city is a near-identical copy of
each other down to parks, street names, and numbering. Visiting one city feels like being in any other city,
granting a level of familiarity and a disconcerting feeling
of having been someplace before but uncertain.  

### POINTS OF INTEREST
**The Chapterhouse Mother School** is the ideal of every
Bene Gesserit to attend, and provides education for
many daughters of Major Houses, sent there for training
if not to join the Sisterhood. The mammoth complex is
at an undisclosed location to accept those the need to
know and protect the school.  

**The Wallach IX Archives** are the most sacred and
secured location on all of Wallach IX. Deep in the
bowels of the archives, under hundreds of meters of
rock, steel, and reinforced plastics, are the records of
the Kwisatz Haderach manipulation.  

The **Three Moons** have orbited the planet since the
time of the cymeks and are believed to be natural.
