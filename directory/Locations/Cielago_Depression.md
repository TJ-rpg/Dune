Named after bats that can carry distrans messages*, the Cielago Depression is one of the most unforgiving and harsh regions on Arrakis. This vast, low-lying region exemplifies the planet’s brutal desert conditions and is shaped by relentless Coriolis sandstorms and the absence of any significant moisture. This natural trap for shifting sands makes navigation treacherous. The deep recesses of the depression intensify heat retention during the day while plunging into freezing temperatures at night. The area is also known to be particularly rich in spice melange deposits and very large sandworms.

*Messages are carried by producing a temporary neural imprint on the nervous system of bats or birds: the creature’s normal cry then carries the message imprint which can be sorted from that carrier wave by another distrans.
