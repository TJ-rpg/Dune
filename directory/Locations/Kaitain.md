### OVERVIEW
A lawful and modern city of beauty that is the seat
of the Empire.  

### HISTORY
Kaitain was untouched by humans or thinking
machines during the Butlerian Jihad and afterwards. House Tantor blasted the capital planet
Salusa Secundus with atomics, laying waste to it.
The current near-uninhabitable state of that planet
forced Emperor Hassik Corrino III to choose a new
seat of power. His advisors provided several alternatives, and Hassik III selected Kaitain.  

The planet’s natural beauty, temperament, and
malleability made it an optimal choice for a new
capital world. Hassik III destroyed House Tantor
in retaliation for Salusa Secundus and wanted
to install a sense of confidence in the people
afterward, to prove House Corrino’s strength and
capability to move forward. Legions of Imperial
construction forces set out to build cities to parallel the planet's natural beauty.  

The capital planet is a picturesque world of grace,
opulence, and abundance. Immense buildings
made of glass and metal reach skyward with
breathtaking art displayed throughout each city.
Each angle, stone, and tree has been precisely
planned to instill the perfect sense of wonder.  

### CULTURE
All worlds within the Imperium are respected but
none more than Kaitain as the seat of Imperial
power. The citizens obeyed the laws and roles set
out before them. Anything less risks the eye of the
Imperial bureaucracy. The people are lawful and
happy, or at the very least appear to be to avoid
repercussions.
