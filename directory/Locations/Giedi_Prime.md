#### OVERVIEW  
A heavily industrialised world with pockets of nature
ruled in an authoritarian manner. The populace works
in the factories, military, or battle in the arenas for the
pleasure of House Harkonnen.  
#### HISTORY  
Giedi Prime during the Butlerian Jihad under the
command of Magnus Sumi was an active member of
the League of Nobles. The planet fell to the thinking
machines, resulting in it being occupied and causing Sumiâ€™s death. Once freed, after the war the planet
became the homeworld of House Harkonnen.  

Giedi Prime is the vehicle House Harkonnen used to
acquire power and move from being a House Minor to
a House Major. Their focus on maximising profit without regard to ethics propelled them to become a powerful House. They rule this planet through a mixture of
fear, a military state, and rewarding treachery, creating
a ruthless society.  
#### CULTURE  
The culture of Giedi Prime is one of oppression. Its
people have few rights and much of the populace are
enslaved. Those that were not enslaved could become
so at the whim of House Harkonnen. The economic
structure was built to move people towards the military
as the only escape from working in the industrial factories until an early death.  
#### ENVIRONMENT  
While once a beautiful world, generations of weapon
manufacturing with little regard to the impact on the
environment turned Giedi Prime into an industrial wasteland under a shiny, pleasant veneer. The Harkonnens
chose a few key cities to make immaculate for visiting
guests and there provide the illusion of luxury.  
#### POINTS OF INTEREST  
House Harkonnen rules the planet of Giedi Prime from the
capital city of **Barony.** Barony resembles historic Rome,
with its population mainly composed of enslaved people
and gladiators battling for the amusement of their lords.
The buildings that dominated the city are all rectangular
with no access on the ground level to keep the enslaved
populace trapped. This way, the enslaved people could
always look skyward towards the Harkonnens.  

**Giedi City** is a shining example of Harkonnen ingenuity
for industrialisation. The city is the primary producer and
government center. Massive weapons factories stand
beside government halls of power, with each working in
perfect unison. The streets, parks, and canals are clean,
appearing as if they are manicured around the clock. In
fact, they are, the enslaved people under a watchful eye
are constantly cleaning the city to maintain the illusion
of industry and civility side-by-side.
