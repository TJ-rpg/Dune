Shaddam Corrino IV, 81st Padishah Emperor of the
known universe, rules the greatest empire ever known to
humankind. The responsibilities and duties of wielding
this enormous power are as burdensome to him as they
were rewarding.  

Like all Corrinos, Shaddam is prone to baroque plans
and a conspiratorial mindset. It is these obsessions that have led Shaddam to court the Baron Harkonnen, a man he finds loathsome, in order to secure what he hopes will be a suitable heir to his lineage and the legacy of his House.
