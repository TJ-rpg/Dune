One of the younger adult nobles in House Nagara,
Geeta has always been restless and eager to follow her
nose into trouble. After showing that she could also
get herself back out of it, she ended up undertaking
official scouting, surveying, and exploration missions
for the House. Geeta enjoys being able to see more
of Arrakis in the service of her House, but she longs to
leave the planet and explore the universe.  
Like many in her House, Geeta has developed a
strong dislike of House Harkonnen. She would love to
contribute to their downfall.  
Geeta is tall and athletic, with dark skin and short hair.
She quickly adapted to stillsuit use, but when sheâ€™s not
wearing one, she likes simple, unencumbering garb.
