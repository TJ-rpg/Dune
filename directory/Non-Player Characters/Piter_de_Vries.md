Piter de Vries was a vicious, sadistic,
and brilliant Mentat, and perhaps
the closest approximation of a friend
to Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. A
product of Bene Tleilax ‘twisting’, de
Vries served as House Harkonnen’s
primary Mentat, working to further
his master’s ambitions.  

Where standard Mentats are
meticulously trained and conditioned to act without base emotion,
de Vries’ worst tendencies had all
been encouraged. While he still
possessed the razor-sharp insight
of any other Mentat, he was prone
to adding cruel flourishes to plans
crafted from the output of his computations. This sadism was highly
appealing to the Baron, who valued
him greatly but never fully trusted
him or considered him anything but
expendable.  

De Vries commanded an intelligence
network to rival that of any power in
the Imperium and schemed ceaselessly on behalf of the Harkonnens,
and likely, himself. The extent of the
evils he accomplished in his life can
only be guessed.
