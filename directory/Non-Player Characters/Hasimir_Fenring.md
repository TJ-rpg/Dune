Supremely deadly, the courtier-assassin Count Hasimir
Fenring was the closest confidant of Emperor Shaddam
IV. The Count was a small, unassuming man, and easily
underestimated — a persona he carefully cultivated.  

A distant cousin to the Emperor, Fenring was Shaddam’s
only real childhood friend. Despite his status as a
genetic eunuch — or perhaps because of it — the Bene
Gesserit maneuvered him into the confidence of the
Emperor. The two men grew to have a genuine friendship, and no other individual enjoyed such trust from
the Emperor. They participated in so many plots and
even assassinations together that Shaddam eventually
feared Fenring might not keep all their secrets. Upon
Shaddam’s ascension, Fenring was rewarded with a marriage to the Bene Gesserit adept Lady Margot, and a
position as Imperial Observer on Arrakis.  

Fenring served the Emperor as an advisor and an emissary in delicate political matters. It was widely believed
that Fenring also operates as an assassin in the Imperial House’s constant political intrigues, but little proof
exists. Even less proof can be found of the accusation
that Fenring was responsible for the previous emperor’s
death by poisoning.  

The Count is known for a stammer and other verbal tics
which makes him frustrating in conversation. In fact,
Fenring’s mannerisms are all conscious choices. Those
who are aware of his full reputation noted the Count’s
disposition as troubling. Baron Vladimir Harkonnen once
described him as “a killer with the manners of a rabbit...
the most dangerous kind.”  

Fenring is often found at the Imperial court but has
been known to turn up in unexpected places, acting as
the Emperor’s eyes and ears, and occasionally delivering
messages on behalf of his Emperor and friend.
