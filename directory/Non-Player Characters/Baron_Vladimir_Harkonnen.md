Siridar Baron Vladimir Harkonnen was one of the most
feared, hated, and admired men in all the Imperium.
From his home on Giedi Prime, the Baron ruled with an
iron fist, sans velvet glove.  

A corpulent and venal man, the Baron took great pleasure in the discomfort his appearance caused in others.
So fat that he required a suspensor harness for mobility, Baron Harkonnen delighted in making his allies and
rivals alike uncomfortable. As a younger man he took
great pride in his body, until a virulent disease corrupted
his hard work. The loss of his athletic physique remained
a sore point to the Baron, although he hid this vanity to
all but those who knew him well.  

Baron Harkonnen was a man of brutal policies but was
possessed of a subtle mind. Having raised his House
to untold heights of power, his schemes and plots were
multitudinous, some decades in the offing. He was a
man who did not brook failure in his subordinates, and
even his own heirs feared and hated him, a fact of which
he was keenly aware and, indeed, encouraged. His
closest confidant was the twisted Mentat Piter de Vries,
chosen by the Baron precisely for his perverse and cynical mind. It was de Vries whom the Baron encouraged to
play his nephews against one another to better control
them. This cruelty in policy dripped down to every level
of the House, and those that toiled under the Harkonnens suffered terribly.  

It was the Baron’s maneuvering that maintained House
Harkonnen in control of Arrakis and the spice melange.
The House’s fortunes swelled under the Baron’s rule,
eclipsing every accomplishment of his forbearers. The
wealth gained legitimately was only eclipsed by the
embezzling and hoarding of spice that occurred under
the Baron’s direction.
