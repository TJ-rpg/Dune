# **Talents**  

## **BINDING PROMISE**  
*Whether through your demeanor, your reputation,
or the method of your persuasion, you have a way of
making people reluctant to break faith with you.*  

When you succeed at a Communicate test to persuade someone to agree to a promise or agreement, you may spend one, two, or three points of Momentum to make that agreement binding. If that person wishes to break
the promise, they must spend Threat equal to twice the
Momentum you spent.  
## **THE SLOW BLADE**  
*The slow blade pierces the shield. You’re well-versed in the subtle ways of avoiding an opponent’s defenses.*  

When you make an attack during a duel or a skirmish
using a melee weapon, and you buy one or more dice
by spending Momentum, you may choose one of the
enemy’s assets in the same zone as your attack; you can
ignore that asset during your attack.  

## **RAPID MANEUVER**  
*You’re fast, able to cross ground, find the shortest
route, and bring your tools to bear quicker than most.*  

When attempting a skill test to reach a destination
quickly when moving on foot or in a vehicle, reduce the Difficulty by 1. In a conflict, when moving an asset, you may move the asset an additional zone for 1 point of Momentum, rather than 2.
