# **Talents**  

## **COOL UNDER PRESSURE (SKILL)**  
*When the situation gets tough, you take a deep breath
and get the job done.*  

When you select this talent, choose a single skill. When
you attempt a test using that skill, before rolling you may
spend a Determination point to automatically succeed at
that test, but you generate no Momentum. The normal
conditions for spending Determination still apply.  
## **SUBTLE STEP**  
*You’re well-versed in methods of avoiding notice, and
you reveal little that you do not intend to.*  

When you attempt a Move test to sneak or otherwise
pass unseen through an area, or when you attempt to
move an asset subtly during a conflict, the first extra d20
you purchase for the test is free.  

## **THE SLOW BLADE**  
*The slow blade pierces the shield. You’re well-versed in
the subtle ways of avoiding an opponent’s defences.*  

When you make an attack during a duel or a skirmish
using a melee weapon, and you buy one or more dice
by spending Momentum, you may choose one of the
enemy’s assets in the same zone as your attack; you can
ignore that asset during your attack.
