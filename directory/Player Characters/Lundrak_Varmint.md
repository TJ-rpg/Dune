# **Talents**  

## **FIND TROUBLE**  
*You know where to find the criminal element wherever you go.*  

Wherever you are, once per adventure, you can always
contact the criminal underworld or black market (as long
as there is one in that area). This doesn’t mean they will be
well disposed toward you, just that you can find a contact.  
## **MASK OF POWER**

*You can intimate that you know more than you do about
an enemy’s secrets.*  

Once per scene you may create an asset (at no cost)
such as blackmail evidence or an owed favor that will
allow you to initiate an intrigue or espionage conflict
with a person of your choosing. The asset is a lie, of
course; you don’t have anything, but your target doesn’t
know that. The asset is removed once the conflict is
over, and if you are defeated the fact you were bluffing
is exposed and you suffer an additional complication.  

## **CAUTIOUS (SKILL)**  
*You are patient and circumspect, acting only when the
odds are in your favour.*  

When you select this talent, choose a single skill. When
you attempt a test using that skill, and you buy additional d20s by spending Momentum, you may re-roll a
single d20 in that dice pool.
