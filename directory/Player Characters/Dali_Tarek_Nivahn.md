# **Talents**  

## **SUBTLE STEP**  
*You’re well-versed in methods of avoiding notice, and
you reveal little that you do not intend to.*  

When you attempt a Move test to sneak or otherwise
pass unseen through an area, or when you attempt to
move an asset subtly during a conflict, the first extra d20
you purchase for the test is free.  
## **PASSIVE SCRUTINY**  
*You are quick to notice details which may be of importance later.*  

When you enter a scene, you may ask one question of
the gamemaster as if you’d spent Momentum to *Obtain
Information*.  

## **SUBTLE WORDS**  
*You are skilled at swaying others with a few quiet words
spoken in the right place at the right time. Even they
may not realise what influence your words have had.*  

When you attempt a Communicate test, and you buy
one or more dice by spending Momentum, you may
create a new trait for free upon the character you have
spoken to, which reflects your influence upon their
thoughts or mood.
