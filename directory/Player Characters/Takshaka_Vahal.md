# **Talents**  

## **MASTER-AT-ARMS**  
*Your expertise in battle is considerable, and few can
match your effectiveness in combat.*  

At the start of a duel, skirmish, or battle scene, select a
single asset that represents a melee weapon or a unit of
troops. Due to your prowess, you may spend 1 Momentum to improve that asset’s Quality by 1 for the next
conflict in this scene.  
## **THE REASON I FIGHT (DUTY)**  
*Skill is not the only factor in determining victory;
those who want it more, and those who are driven by
a greater sense of purpose, may triumph when they
should have failed.*  

When you select this talent, choose a single drive rated
6 or higher. When you attempt a Battle test using the
chosen drive, and the drive’s statement aligns with the
action being attempted, you may re-roll 1d20.  

## **PASSIVE SCRUTINY**  
*You are quick to notice details which may be of importance later.*  

When you enter a scene, you may ask one question of
the gamemaster as if you’d spent Momentum to *Obtain
Information*.
