# **Talents**  

## **PUTTING THEORY INTO PRACTICE**  
*You’ve learned how to quickly turn newfound knowledge into a practical advantage.*  

Once per scene, when you *Obtain Information,* you
may create a trait for free, which must represent an
advantage, opportunity, or weakness you’ve identified
with the information you received.  
## **PASSIVE SCRUTINY**  
*You are quick to notice details which may be of importance later.*  

When you enter a scene, you may ask one question of
the gamemaster as if you’d spent Momentum to *Obtain
Information*.  

## **SUBTLE STEP**  
*You’re well-versed in methods of avoiding notice, and
you reveal little that you do not intend to.*  

When you attempt a Move test to sneak or otherwise
pass unseen through an area, or when you attempt to
move an asset subtly during a conflict, the first extra d20
you purchase for the test is free.
